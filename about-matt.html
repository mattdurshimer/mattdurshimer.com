<p>Matthew Steven “Matt” Durshimer, P.E. is a Professional Civil Engineer who is currently a Project Manager and Senior Bridge Designer for WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff, a publicly traded engineering consulting firm. Despite being only 28 years old, Matt is one of the most experienced Design/Build Engineers working in the Southeast United States.</p>

<p>In under 4 years, Matt has designed over 25 bridges for interstate construction projects with a total contract value in excess of $400 million dollars. 21 of the bridges have fully completed construction and are open to traffic while the remaining 4 are currently under construction with a scheduled opening date within the next 5 years.</p>

<p>Matt recently earned his Professional Engineering license after 4 years of Engineering apprenticeship and by passing the State wide licensing test. A Florida native and Tampa resident for the last 10 years, Matt’s successful rise to management stems from his Bachelors and Masters Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of South Florida and his close knowledge of both design and construction techniques - otherwise known as “means and methods”.</p>

<p>Currently serving as a Project Manager for a $120 million dollar Everglades Restoration Design/Build pursuit, Matt and his design team are engineering solutions to remove the existing causeway and replace it with bridge in an extremely environmentally sensitive area. The paramount goal of this project is for rehabilitation of the Florida Everglades. Therefore, Matt’s top priorities are to minimize construction impact to the ecosystem and traveling public while designing the most economical solution that saves tax-payers money, but still delivering an exceptional finished product. Concurrently with this role, Matt is the Deputy Project Manager for a $500 million dollar 3 mile bridging pursuit that will span Pensacola Bay in Florida’s panhandle where he shares similar goals.</p>
